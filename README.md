# Household Travel Behavior Surveys

The **hhts** repository houses the procedures to take raw Household Travel Behavior survey datasets to cleaned datasets ready for analysts or for storage in SANDAG's SQL environment. The repository's release branches are tagged with the Household Travel Behavior survey year they apply to and are compatible with. The main branch is the most recent development branch, currently for the 2016 Household Travel Behavior survey. See the [Wiki](https://github.com/SANDAG/hhts/wiki) for detailed descriptions of the projects and their datasets.
